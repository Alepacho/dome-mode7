# DOME : Mode 7

![](pictures/1.png)

This is a simple demo showing Mode 7 using Dome Engine (Wren scripting language).

## Controls

* Movement : `WASD` or `Arrows`
* Change FOV : `ZX`
* Change Height : `Space C`

## How 2 run?

Install [Dome Engine](https://domeengine.com/). 

I use Dome 1.8.2 btw.

### If you use Windows
Copy `dome.exe` to the folder and then run it.

### If you are a UNIX user
Open this folder in terminal and then type this:

```bash
$ dome
```

Dome Engine will run `main.wren` automatically.
